## Function Descriptions

### `createMST(startNode, links)`
- Creates a Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) starting from the specified node (`startNode`).
- Iterates through the sorted links and adds them to the MST if they connect two nodes that haven't been visited yet.
- Returns the MST as an array of links.

### `generateMatchings(nodes)`
- Generates all possible perfect matchings from the provided array of nodes.
- Recursively generates matchings by pairing the first node with each subsequent node and then generating matchings for the remaining nodes.
- Returns an array containing all possible matchings as arrays of pairs.

### `findBest(matchings)`
- Finds the best matching from a set of matchings based on the total distance.
- Iterates through each matching, calculates the total distance, and keeps track of the matching with the minimum distance.
- Returns the links of the best matching.

### `generateMultigraph(links)`
- Generates a multigraph by adding links to the provided array of links.
- Determines the nodes with odd degrees and generates all possible matchings among them.
- Returns a new array of links, including the original links and additional links from the best matching among the odd-degree nodes.

### `findEulerianTour(links, startNode)`
- Finds an Eulerian tour starting from a specified node in a graph represented by a set of links.
- Constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph and performs a depth-first search (DFS) to find the tour.
- Returns the Eulerian tour as an array of nodes.

### `twoOpt(tour)`
- Applies the 2-opt optimization heuristic to a given tour to improve its distance.
- Continuously performs swaps on segments of the tour until no improvement can be made.
- Returns the optimized tour with the shortest distance.
